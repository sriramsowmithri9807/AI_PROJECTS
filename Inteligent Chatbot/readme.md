# Intelligent Chatbot

This repository contains the code for an intelligent chatbot, designed to engage users in natural and meaningful conversations. It leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, machine learning models, and integrates with vector databases for enhanced knowledge retrieval.

## Features

* **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** The chatbot can understand user input in natural language, including variations in phrasing and intent.
* **Contextual Awareness:** Maintains context throughout the conversation, allowing for more coherent and relevant responses.
* **Machine Learning Powered:** Uses machine learning models to learn from user interactions and improve its performance over time.
* **Customizable Responses:** Easily customize the chatbot's responses to fit your specific needs and use cases.
* **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to handle a large volume of user interactions.
* **Vector Database Integration:** Utilizes Pinecone or ChromaDB for efficient semantic search and knowledge retrieval.
* **LangChain Integration:** Leverages LangChain for streamlined development of language model applications.
* **OpenAI API Usage:** Integrates with the OpenAI API for powerful language model capabilities.
* **Flask Web Application:** Deploys the chatbot as a web application using Flask.
* **Environment variable management:** Uses python-dotenv to manage sensitive information.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.6+
* pip
* Virtual environment (recommended)
* OpenAI API Key
* Pinecone API Key (if using Pinecone) or ChromaDB installed.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/intelligent-chatbot.git](https://github.com/your-username/intelligent-chatbot.git)
    cd intelligent-chatbot
    ```

2.  Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key (If using Pinecone)
    PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=your_pinecone_environment (If using Pinecone)
    ```

### Training the Model (If applicable)

1.  Prepare your training data. The data should be in a format suitable for the chosen NLP model and vector database. (e.g., JSON, CSV).
2.  Run the training script (if needed for your setup):

    ```bash
    python train.py --data_path path/to/your/data.json --model_path path/to/save/model
    ```

    (Adjust the arguments according to your implementation)

### Running the Chatbot

1.  Run the Flask application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2.  Access the chatbot through your web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` or the specified port.

## Usage

Once the chatbot is running, you can start interacting with it through the web interface. The chatbot will process your input, retrieve relevant information from the vector database (if configured), and provide responses generated by the OpenAI API.
